## Extension Manual Install
This guide will walk you through the steps for manually installing a Chrome extension. This is useful if you cannot find the extension on the Chrome Web Store or if you prefer not to install extensions through the store.

### Step 1:
Clone this repository:
'git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/meow-jsx/BrowserBot'

### Step 2: Enable Developer Mode in Chrome
In order to install a Chrome extension manually, you need to enable Developer Mode in Chrome. Here's how to do it:
Open Chrome and go to the three dots menu in the top-right corner.
Select "More tools" and then "Extensions".
Toggle on the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner.

### Step 3: Install the Extension
Now that you have the extension downloaded (this repository source code) and Developer Mode enabled in Chrome, you can install the extension. Here's how to do it:
In Chrome, go to the "Extensions" page (you can find it by going to the three dots menu in the top-right corner and selecting "More tools" > "Extensions").
Drag and drop the folder containing the extension files onto the Extensions page. Alternatively, you can click the "Load unpacked" button in the top-left corner and select the folder containing the extension files.
The extension should now be installed and ready to use!
